# Themis

Citizense's first application, Themis, is a bill tracker for upcoming and current pieces of legislation organized by states and issues. The purpose and goals of its existence is to provide an investigative tool of the United States government (for now), to provide a nonpartisan source for users that may rely on social media as their tunnel for news, and to help make mutual decisions between the people and the government. Themis wants to make sure we provide the following: 
  - Bill tracking based on local/favored issues for updates and news
  - In-depth analysis providing summaries and for/against arguments 
  - More to come... 
  
Special thanks to GovTrack for providing resources for open data usage in congressional bills.
