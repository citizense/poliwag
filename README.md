# Themis

Citizense's first application, Themis, is a bill tracker for upcoming and current pieces of legislation organized by states and issues. The purpose and goals of its existence is to provide an investigative tool for the United States government (for now) to provide a nonpartisan source for users that may rely on social media as their tunnel for news. Themis wants to make sure we provide the following: 
  - Bill tracking based on local/favored issues for updates and news
  - In-depth analysis providing summaries and for/against arguments 
  - More to come...
